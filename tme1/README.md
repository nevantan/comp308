## Unit 1: Learning Objective 1
**Prompt:** Review the checklist and install the software if necessary.

This isn't exactly a question but I thought my process was interesting enough to
document for this assignment.

The checklist in the article provided lists two requirements:
1. The Java SE Development Kit 8 (JDK 8)
2. A text editor. 

Initially, I had assumed I already had the JDK installed. However, after attempting to
run `javac -version`, I realized that this was not the case. For reference, my desktop
is running Ubuntu 16.10. As I am planning to reformat my desktop soon, instead of setting
up the JDK 8, I decided to use Google Cloud Shell instead. As it turns out, the shell is
pre-configured for OpenJDK 8 and comes with an in-browser code editor, which satisfies
the second item on the checklist as well.

This approach allows me to keep all of my data in the cloud and access it from any device
so long as I have an internet connection.
